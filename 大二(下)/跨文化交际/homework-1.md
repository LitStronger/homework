Friends are playmates for Chinese people. People are more inclined to ask for help when they have problems.  Friends are more like mere playmates to americans. they are more independent, more likely to solve problems on their own, and less likely to rely on friends. I don't think there is much of a difference. They both treat their friends as playmates. It's just that americans and Chinese have different ways on solving things.
