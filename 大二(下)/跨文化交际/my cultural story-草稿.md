我出生在广州，但我的家乡并不是广州，而是广东的另一个地方揭阳。虽然从小在广州生活了10年左右，但是我对广州的文化的了解却是非常地模糊。反倒是后来转学回了家乡，对家乡的特色小吃记忆深刻。

回想在广州的时光，对我影响比较深的方面是语言，我学会了当地日常生活学习的用到的粤语。虽然到现在已经过去十年了，身边没有说粤语的朋友，太久没接触，很多都已经忘记了。吃的方面，最喜欢吃当地的荔枝

我在揭阳生活了也将近10年，除了家乡话潮汕话之外，我还接触了一些别的方言，如客家话。在接触了好几种语言后，我发现它们在语法结构上其实几乎是完全一样的，比较大的差别只有发音，有了这个发现，我很快就掌握了这些方言的日常用语，并且发音方面还听标准，因此同学们常常猜错我的家乡，但因为在学校的缘故，大家为了方便学习交流，其实用的最多的还是Chinese。虽然学了几门语言，但我的英语却并不是特别好，我觉得问题在于没有把英语用于实践，只用课本里是很难达到实践效果的，也许去国外住一段时间就能学会了。揭阳在吃的方面就有很多了，我最喜欢的是高中学校后门的肠粉，这可是潮汕美食，在广东的各各城市都可以见到卖肠粉的店，为了吃肠粉，今年我还专门从家里坐车一个多小时赶到学校。

来到HDU后，有幸与墨西哥的几个研究生一起做项目，他们都很热情，那段时间里并没有因为文化差异而发生意外，我们一起去吃火锅，烤肉，后来他们带我们一家墨西哥餐厅--拉邦吧，除了不喜欢牛油果，其他还是都非常好吃的。他们给我的感觉就像是普通的朋友，但却有一种说不出的新奇感，我enjoy这种感觉，期待以后有机会能结识更多有趣的外国朋友。

I was born in Guanghou, but my hometown is not Guangzhou, but another place in Guangdong, Jieyang. Although I have lived in guangzhou for about 10 years since I was born, I don't know much about guangzhou. Instead, I  had a deep memory of my hometown, Jieyang. Later, I went to Hangzhou to go to college.



When I think back on my time in guangzhou, what has a deep influence on me is the local  language. I learned the cantonese that is used in daily life and study there. But it has been ten years now,  there are no friends speaking cantonese around,  many have forgotten. So I can't speak cantonese fluently now, For the food there, I like  the litchi(荔枝) best.



I have been living in jieyang for nearly 10 years. In adcdition to Teochew dialect(潮汕话), I have also been exposed to other dialects, such as Hakka dialect(客家话). After contact with several languages, I find that they are the same on the grammatical structure, the   difference is only the pronunciation, with this discovery, I quickly mastered the language of these dialects using on daily life, and I could speak quite well. So students in the class often guess wrong about my hometown.  In fact , most of all communicated in Chinese in order to communicate conveniently in the school . Although I have learned several languages, my English is not very good. I think the problem is that I have not taken  English into daily live. It is difficult to achieve practical effect only by using textbooks. My hometown Jieyang has a lot of delicious food. My favourite one is the steamed vermicelli roll(肠粉) ,which is a kind of Chaozhou-Shantou region food. 



Later,I came to HDU. And last year I have taken part in a project with several Mexican graduate students. They are very enthusiastic. During that time there isn't any accident happening because of cultural differences. We go to eat hot pot, barbecue. And then they took us  to a Mexican restaurant--labamba. The Mexican food is very tasty. I like all Mexican food except avocados(牛油果). I think that there are no much on foreign friends, but brings me a sense of novelty. I enjoy this feeling and look forward to meeting more interesting foreign friends in the future.
